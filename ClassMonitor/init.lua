-- finish colors
-- free anchors (one mover for each plugin)
-- [DONE]auto anchors (based on index in config, index 0 is on mover, -1 above, +1 below, ...) (if 2 with the same index, they are put on the same line)

-- set vertical/horizontal indexes in config
-- frames with identical coordinates (verticalIndex and horizontalIndex are anchored at the same place)
-- remove MOVER from plugin
-- new plugin for monk brew: 1st phase: display charge count and time left, 2nd phase (when brew activated): buff time left
-- when a plugin settings are invalid, create a text in plugin bar to display an error message
